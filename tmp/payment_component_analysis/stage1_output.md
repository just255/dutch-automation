## Instructions for HTML Analysis

1. Use Grep to search for specific elements (don't read the entire file unless necessary)
2. Find locators following priority: IDs (element/parent/container) → XPath (no text)
3. For each element found, provide:
   - The exact HTML snippet
   - The recommended locator(s) in order of priority
   - Any relevant parent container IDs or classes
4. Output findings to: `E:\Dutch Automation\tmp\payment_component_analysis\stage2_output.md`

The stage2_output.md should contain a prompt for the main SDET session with exact locator code to write into the PaymentComponent class, formatted as Python Playwright locators.

## Additional Notes

- This is a payment/subscription component using Stripe for payment processing
- The component includes email/phone contact fields, payment method selection, and terms agreement
- Some elements may be dynamically loaded or within iframes (especially Stripe payment fields)
- Look for data attributes, aria labels, and semantic HTML for robust locators
- Credit card input fields (number, CVV, expiry, name) may appear when "Card" radio is selected - check for conditional/dynamic elements
