# AI-Assisted Development Artifacts

This folder contains examples of the AI-assisted development process used to build this framework.

## Contents

**`pet_info_analysis/`** - Example of AI-assisted Page Object creation
- Shows the iterative process of analyzing a web page
- Demonstrates locator strategy selection
- Illustrates Page Object Model implementation

**`payment_component_analysis/`** - Example of AI-assisted Component creation
- Shows component composition approach
- Demonstrates handling complex UI elements (Stripe iframe)
- Illustrates reusable component design

## Development Approach

Each analysis follows a structured process:
1. **Stage 1:** Element identification and locator strategy
2. **Stage 2:** Code generation with Page Object Model pattern

This demonstrates effective use of AI tools while maintaining full understanding of framework architecture and design patterns.
