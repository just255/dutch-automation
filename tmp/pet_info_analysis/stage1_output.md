## Instructions for HTML Analysis

1. Use Grep to search for specific elements (don't read the entire file)
2. For each element, search for:
   - ID attributes on the element itself
   - ID attributes on parent or container elements
   - Name attributes
   - Class attributes that might be useful
   - Data attributes (data-*)
3. Find locators following priority: IDs (element/parent/container) → XPath (no text)
4. Avoid text-based locators when possible - prefer structural locators
5. For radio buttons, find both individual button locators and the group container
6. Output findings to: `E:\Dutch Automation\tmp\pet_info_analysis\stage2_output.md`

The stage2_output.md should contain a prompt for the main SDET session with exact locator code to write into the PetInfoPage class.

## Expected Output Format for stage2_output.md

```markdown
# Stage 3 Prompt: Write PetInfoPage Class Locators

Based on HTML analysis, write the following locators into the PetInfoPage class file.

## File Location
[Specify the PetInfoPage class file path]

## Locators to Add

For each element, provide:
- Locator name (following naming convention)
- Locator strategy (ID, CSS, XPath)
- Exact locator string
- Python/Java/C# code snippet ready to paste

Example format:
```python
# Pet Type Selection
DOG_RADIO_BUTTON = (By.ID, "pet-type-dog")
CAT_RADIO_BUTTON = (By.ID, "pet-type-cat")
```

Or if using XPath:
```python
DOG_RADIO_BUTTON = (By.XPATH, "//div[@id='pet-type-container']//input[@value='dog']")
```
```

## Additional Notes

- The page appears to be the first step in a multi-step registration process (indicated by breadcrumb: Pet info > Registration > Checkout > Connect with vet)
- All three fields appear to be required to proceed (the Continue button likely validates these fields)
- The pet type field is explicitly marked as required with an asterisk (*)
- The form is simple and focused on basic pet information only
- No file upload, photo upload, or additional fields like breed, age, weight are visible on this page
- This appears to be a simplified initial pet info collection page, with more detailed information likely collected in subsequent steps
